# Starbucks Inventory Management System

This is a web-based inventory management system designed especially for Starbucks. It allows different users (Managers and Leads) to view, update, and manage inventory data for different store locations. The system uses Firebase as its database and leverages client-side authentication via custom password prompts. The inventory interface is user-friendly, and the authentication process is persistent so that you won’t have to enter your passwords on every refresh.
