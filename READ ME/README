# Inventory Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based application that helps stores manage their inventory. It is built to be user-friendly so that even if you don’t know how to code, you can still use it easily. The system helps track items in different inventory categories (like milk, syrups, cups, etc.) and supports different roles for users (Managers, Leads, and Admins).

## What It Does
- **User Roles:**
  - **Manager:** Has the ability to view and update the inventory for any store. A special manager password is required.
  - **Lead:** Can manage the inventory for a specific store. Leads must first pick a store and then log in with that store’s password.
  - **Admin:** Has extra tools to update or reset passwords and can force all users to sign out. Admins use their own password.

- **Inventory Management:**
  - **View Inventory:** The screen is divided into different categories (e.g., milks, syrups, cups, etc.).
  - **Add or Remove Items:** You can add a new item or remove an existing item from any category.
  - **Update Quantities:** Change the numbers next to items to show current stock levels.
  - **Clear a Category:** If needed, you can clear all the items in a category with just a click (after confirming your decision).

- **Notes:**
  - There is a section to write notes. These notes save automatically so you won’t lose them if you change pages.

- **Inventory List:**
  - You can generate a neat list of the current inventory and then copy it to your clipboard. This is useful if you need to share the list or review it later.

- **Switch Store:**
  - If you need to change the store you are working on, you can use the "Switch Store" button. This keeps your role (Manager, Lead, or Admin) intact, but lets you pick a new store.

- **Admin Tools:**
  - If you log in as an Admin, you can update the passwords for Managers and for each store.
  - There is also an option to reset all passwords to their default settings.
  - The Admin can sign out all users if necessary.

## How to Use
1. **Open the Application:**
   - Open the file named `index.html` in your web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox).

2. **Select Your Role:**
   - When you first load the app, you will see buttons for Manager, Lead, and Admin. Click the button that matches your role.

3. **Log In:**
   - Enter the password required for your role:
     - **Managers** and **Admins** have their own passwords.
     - **Leads** must first choose a store (from a list) and then enter the password for that store.

4. **Manage Inventory:**
   - Once you are logged in, you will see the inventory for the selected store.
   - You can adjust the numbers (quantities) for each item.
   - Use the “Add Item” button to add new inventory items.
   - Remove items or clear an entire category with the provided buttons (each action asks for a confirmation).

5. **Write Notes:**
   - Type any notes in the notes section. These notes save automatically, so you won’t lose your work.

6. **Generate and Copy the Inventory List:**
   - Click the “Generate List” button to create a text list of the current inventory.
   - Then click “Copy List” to copy this text so you can paste it elsewhere.

7. **Switch Store:**
   - If you need to work on a different store, click the “Switch Store” button.
   - This will clear the current store selection (while keeping your role) and show you the store selection screen again.

8. **Admin Panel (Admins Only):**
   - If you are an Admin, after logging in you will see extra controls:
     - Update passwords for Managers or for individual stores.
     - Reset all passwords back to the default values.
     - Sign out all users if needed.

## What You Need
- **A Computer with a Web Browser:** Such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.
- **Internet Connection:** The app uses the internet to store and retrieve data.
- **Firebase Setup (For the Developer/Administrator):**
  - The project uses [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database) for data storage.
  - To use the app with your own settings, update the Firebase configuration in the `script.js` file.

## Folder Structure
The project includes three main files:



## In Short
